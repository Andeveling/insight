## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Setup)
    ↓ BLOCKS
Phase 2 (US1) ←──────────────────────────────┐
    ↓ (optional)                              │
Phase 3 (US2) ←── Can run parallel with US1 ──┤
    ↓ (optional)                              │
Phase 4 (US3) ←── Can run parallel with US1 ──┘
    ↓ (optional)
Phase 5 (US4) ←── Depends on at least US1 for testing
    ↓ (optional)
Phase 6 (US5) ←── Badge logic depends on US1-US3 actions existing
    ↓
Phase 7 (Polish) ←── All stories complete
```

### User Story Dependencies

| Story | Priority | Dependencies                         | Can Parallel With     |
| ----- | -------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| US1   | P1       | Phase 1 complete                     | US2, US3              |
| US2   | P1       | Phase 1 complete                     | US1, US3              |
| US3   | P2       | Phase 1 complete                     | US1, US2              |
| US4   | P2       | Phase 1 + at least one action exists | None (UI integration) |
| US5   | P3       | Phase 1 + US1-US3 actions            | None (badge criteria) |

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**:
```
T006, T007, T008, T009 → All component creation in parallel
```

**Phase 2-4 (US1-US3)**:
```
After Phase 1:
  US1 (T013-T023) ─┬─ US2 (T024-T031) ─┬─ US3 (T032-T038)
                   │                   │
                   └───────────────────┘
  (All three user stories can run in parallel if capacity allows)
```

**Phase 7 (Polish)**:
```
T052, T053, T058, T059 → Documentation and validation in parallel
```
